# Feature Specification: Follow-Up Questions

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to add a feature that after the initial reading, there is an option for a follow up question, make this a variable, but this is the contant for now: Free 1 follow up, pro 3 follow up, pro+ 5 follow up. I think if would be better if these were in a thread so that the ai will have better inference. And then the response should be very conversational and direct to the point, and keep it to 1 to 4 sentences only. And the button to end the reading must be present. The reading will end after the user presses the button or the the follow up questions are used up."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Ask Follow-Up Questions (Priority: P1)

A user receives their initial tarot reading and wants to ask deeper questions about the interpretation to gain more clarity and understanding.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables deeper engagement with the tarot readings, potentially increasing user satisfaction and retention by providing personalized, contextual guidance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending a follow-up question after an initial reading and receiving a conversational response with an end reading option.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has received an initial tarot reading, **When** they ask a follow-up question, **Then** they receive a conversational response (1-4 sentences) that builds on the original reading context
2. **Given** a user is in a follow-up conversation, **When** they press the end reading button, **Then** the conversation ends gracefully with a closing message
3. **Given** a free user has used their 1 follow-up question, **When** they try to ask another question, **Then** they receive an upgrade prompt instead of another reading

### User Story 2 - Subscription-Based Question Limits (Priority: P2)

Different user subscription tiers have different follow-up question limits, encouraging upgrades while providing value to all users.

**Why this priority**: Creates a natural upgrade path that provides value at every tier while monetizing deeper engagement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that users see appropriate question counters and upgrade prompts based on their subscription level.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a free user has 0 follow-ups remaining, **When** they try to ask a question, **Then** they see an upgrade prompt with Pro benefits
2. **Given** a Pro user has 2 follow-ups remaining, **When** they ask a question, **Then** the counter decreases to 1 and they can continue asking
3. **Given** a Pro+ user has used all 5 follow-ups, **When** they press end reading, **Then** the conversation ends with a thank you message

### User Story 3 - Threaded AI Context (Priority: P3)

The AI maintains context from the initial reading throughout the follow-up conversation for more coherent and personalized responses.

**Why this priority**: Ensures follow-up responses are relevant and build meaningfully on the original reading, creating a more authentic tarot consultation experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by comparing follow-up responses to ensure they reference the original cards and interpretation appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user asked about "career changes" in their initial reading, **When** they ask "What about timing?" as a follow-up, **Then** the response references the original card positions and maintains career context
2. **Given** a user is in a follow-up thread, **When** they ask ambiguous questions, **Then** the AI uses the original reading context to provide relevant interpretations

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to ask a follow-up question before receiving an initial reading?
- How does the system handle users who rapidly ask multiple questions without waiting for responses?
- What happens when a user's subscription changes mid-conversation?
- How does the system prevent users from gaming the system with repetitive or off-topic questions?
- What happens when the AI service fails during a follow-up response?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-004**: System MUST provide conversational responses limited to 1-4 sentences per follow-up question
- **FR-005**: System MUST always display an "End Reading" button alongside follow-up question input
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically end the reading session when follow-up questions are exhausted or user presses "End Reading" button
- **FR-007**: System MUST display remaining question count to users throughout the conversation
- **FR-008**: System MUST show upgrade prompts to free users when they exhaust their follow-up limit
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate follow-up questions are relevant to the original reading context
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle conversation state persistence across Messenger sessions
